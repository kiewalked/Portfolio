After taking a shower, I also had a shower thought (heh) that this year hasn't gone all that bad. Whilst I may not have made much visible progress, I think a key thing that I've done this year is experiment a lot and fail a lot of times. That's invaluable because learning is a balancing process; learning from others is simply a _resource_ that can be leveraged to get a start, but the actual learning doesn't happen without _experience_. It's something I took for granted in the past, since I was just trying to always optimise my learning and try to pick something up as fast as possible, but without the actual experience, you will never know why something truly works, and thus it becomes unsustainable. My overthinking brain would constantly consider "oh but what if this way is better", but not actually do it. Now that I have experienced what it is like to fail in setting habits, I know the particular ways that I tend to fail accomplishing those goals, and as such, can formulate ways to avoid them.

This is a key that I can also take to my teaching. Teaching should not be about simply talking from your own experience, but also accounting for the experiences of the student. Allow them to experience the things that will allow them to learn for themselves, rather than shoving your own experiences down their throat. One such example will be things like assignments. Rather than doing their assignment for them, and showing them what the result is, let them experience those struggles themselves, and act as a gentle guide in the right direction. Without those revelations, they won't understand what it's like to fail and have that failure propel them into a solution, they will simply associate finding the solution with finding out from others. I think that's something I fell victim to in particular, because I started to just be so afraid of failing that I would always look something up. Whilst that's a useful skill, it's also important to be able to accept failure, so that's just something to keep in mind I suppose.
