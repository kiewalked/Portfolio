Welcome to my blog! ðŸ˜Š

My portfolio website has been a project on the back of my mind for the past few years, and with it, I had always intended to create a blog as an outlet to share some of my favourite things that I have learnt over my past years. As I have recently finished all of my course work, it seemed fitting to finally get around to building this website, and being able to host my blog through it.

The content of the blog will mainly cover my personal interests, including:

1. Coding & software (competitive programming & web/mobile development are my main interests right now)
2. Personal growth & productivity
3. Assorted sports ramblings (ultimate frisbee & volleyball)

For anyone who has the opportunity to read this, thank you, and I hope you are able to learn a thing or two from the posts that I make throughout the years :).
