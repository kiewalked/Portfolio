## Background

My honours thesis project was a mobile application developed for the Keeping Body in Mind (KBIM) team in Sydney Eastern Suburbs Local Health District (SESLHD) to assist in their clinical procedures.

The KBIM program is a physical wellbeing program targeted at young individuals diagnosed with early stage psychosis. It was initially founded due to the well researched links of severe mental illness with a decline in physical health outcomes. Their team consists of numerous health professionals, whom work together to provide protocols to their clients to combat the effects and aim to reduce the decline, such as improving weight gain, sleep, nutrition and smoking.

For my project, I was responsible for designing and building an application to be used by the clients that would assist the clinicians in collecting data on their physical health outcomes in order to guide the overall progression of each individual.

## Final Product & Results

The final product was a frontend prototype developed in React Native, which provided features that aimed to satisfy requirements specified by the KBIM team. These features included:

1. Daily data collection of physical health measures & historical data viewing.
2. Daily notifications with customisable frequency and time selection
3. Interval based goal setting with time-based reminders
4. Native camera integration to allow for specific data input

The project was successful in receiving a $100,000 grant to support its development under the UNSW Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering (GSBME), and further work will be continued by future Honours students as well as the developers under GSBME.
